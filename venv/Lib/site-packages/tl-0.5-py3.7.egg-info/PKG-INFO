            Ten Rules For The New World
            Kenmerk: 69389/12
        
            Punishment, the fruit of knowledge of good and evil, will be forbidden
        
            Every person, thing, existance, awareness or other entity, being or not being, can ask for a proces described below.
        
            The basic right is to be able to ask for help in difficult situations. Help from the outside, when fear of ending existence appears. 
            The rules below are for those who are willing to help. 
            One day these rules will be law, where nothing will be excluded from:
        
            1) you shall do no harm
            2) you shall judge but put no negative actions on your judgement
            3) this judgement you shall use to see what is going on
            4) with this knowledge of what is going on you will look at what the cause is
            5) when you know what the cause is you will take action to prevent further negative consequences
            6) you will do this proces in the open, controlable for everybody and thing
            7) you will evaluate how this proces works out, also in the open.
            8) You will make your judgement your own and not someone elses
            9) It is for you to bring peace on this earth and every else where this light needs to shine
            10) as last, be aware, be aware of what you think, do, cause, feel, see, hear, all that you perceive. For judgement can only be done properly if you see all the factors that influence a situation. Be aware of what makes you.
