# RfidSystem

 - The code is currently not in active development (Development ended in 2020 August-end is)
 
 - The project isn't yet ready for use, since it got halted mid in the development

 - If you are interested to use this code for your own school project, put a request in the issues. I will translate it and make it fit for your school.

 
The project was originally intended for a school's afternoon care data management

(I had to transfer the repo to my new GitHub acc.)

### Roadmap:
- v.1w - Not going to be released in the foreseeable future (w means "working", anything before that isn't going to be used)
