# RfidSystem

 - The code is currently not in active development (Development ended in 2020 August-end)

 - Please don't mind "ugly-looking" or "inefficient" code, I also know this, I have started working on it in 2018 (my knowlage as a 4th grader in "clean-code" or "fast-running-not-so-much-space-consuming-stuff" wasn't verry much. But it would do the job.

 - If you are interested to use this code for your own school project, put a request in the issues. I will translate it and make it fit for your school.

 
The project was originally intended for a school's afternoon care data management

### Roadmap:
- v.1w - Not going to be released in the foreseeable future
