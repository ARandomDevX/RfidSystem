 Note:
  - The Code is currently not beeing actively Worked on, till i recive contacty from the person, who is getting the code. Without that i can't continue
  - Feel Free to use parts of this code for your own projects
  - Please don't mind "ugly-looking" or "inneficient" code, i also know, this i have started working in 2018 (my knowlage as a 4th grader in "clean-code" or "fast-running-not-so-much-space-consuming-stuff" wasn't verry much. But it would do the job. (If the guy who wanted the code would EVER reply to my messages!)
  - If anyone has intrest in using the code for their school Registery stuff, put a request in the issues. I will Translate it and make it fit for your school.(Btw. i can only do it if i have some time left, i will try, but i can't garantue you that it's going to be optimized for your useage)

The Script, was intended for a school's afternoon care stuff, so that you can check-in students and check where they are and all that administratory stuff

### Roadmap:
 v.1w - Not going to be released in the forseable future, since the guy isn't responding
